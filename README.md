## Belly Budget
Am I working out enough to work off what I just ate? How many calorie is this slice of cake? How long should I be on the treadmill to work off 400 calories? If you find yourself asking those type of questions then this application is for you. Simply type in the type of food you're about to eat (or thinking of eating) to see its calorie count and other nutrition facts. Stop there or continue to see recommendations on the type of exercises and how long you should be doing them to burn off the unwanted calories. This application is perfect for those who: 
* Count calories
* Have a desire to loose weight
* Wish to maintain a healthy lifestyle
* Are just currious
